# Add To Google Reader Safari Extension

A simple Safari extension that hijacks the RSS button in the address bar and redirects to Google Reader. The extension provides an option, turned off by default, to subscribe via iGoogle as well. If the option is turned on, the user is redirected to the page that offers the option of subscribing via iGoogle or Google Reader.
