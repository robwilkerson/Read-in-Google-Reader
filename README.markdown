# Add To Google Reader Safari Extension

A simple extension for Safari 5 that redirects Safariâ€™s RSS button directly to Google Reader. There <del>is</del> was an option, disabled by default, to stop at the page allowing the user to add the feed to iGoogle instead. This option has been removed for reasons details on the [project wiki](http://codaset.com/robwilkerson/add-to-google-reader/wiki) and on [my personal blog](http://weblog.robwilkerson.org/post/847094732/add-to-google-reader-changes).

## Installation

The [compiled extension](http://robwilkerson.org/_resources/projects/safari/extensions/AddToGoogle.safariextz) is located in the `target/` directory.

1. Download the [compiled extension](http://robwilkerson.org/_resources/projects/safari/extensions/AddToGoogle.safariextz).

    **NOTE:** The links should work, but if you're sent to a page of jibberish, you may have to right click (or option-click) and select one of the "Download Linked File" options.

1. Double click the downloaded file to install.
