# Add To Google Reader Safari Extension

A simple extension for Safari 5 that redirects Safariâ€™s RSS button directly to Google Reader instead. There is an option, disabled by default, to stop at the page allowing the user to add the feed to iGoogle instead.

## Installation

The [compiled extension](http://robwilkerson.org/_resources/projects/safari/extensions/AddToGoogle.safariextz) is located in the `target/` directory.

1. Download the [compiled extension](http://robwilkerson.org/_resources/projects/safari/extensions/AddToGoogle.safariextz).

    **NOTE:** The links should work, but if you're sent to a page of jibberish, you may have to right click (or option-click) and select one of the "Download Linked File" options.

1. Double click the downloaded file to install.

## Credits

This project was forked from [Chupa](http://github.com/Chupa)'s excellent original. I learned a lot from building on his original work.
